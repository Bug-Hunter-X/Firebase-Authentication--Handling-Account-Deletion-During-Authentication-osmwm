The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's account is deleted or disabled after the authentication process has begun but before it has completed.  This can occur during a multi-step authentication flow (like email/password verification).  The SDK may not handle this scenario gracefully and might not provide a clear error message, leading to confusion and unexpected behavior in the application.  The developer may see a generic Firebase error, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.
